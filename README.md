Ideas for game:
2-D
shoot em up style side scroller
ideas for mechanics:
all shapes, the more sides a shape has the more dangerous it is, or fractals, the higher the dimmension between 1.0 and 2.0 the greater the danger
mechanics needed:
health, damage, projectiles, powerups/upgrades? (maybe sides can represent health and each time an enemy (or you) gets hit you lose a side)
points system
spawning system for enemies
movement system for enemies
control system for player
render system
Bosses?
menu system
settings for low/medium/high system requirements?
royalty-free music and sound effects
animations for enemies and player
background?

i think a possible idea could be to have the Ushape (aka the player) stay within the same 'box'
and the enemies come from around the edges of the box into the player's screen
every once in a while (or at the end of the game) a massive boss shape could appear

Tools requested:
Git and GitKraken for version control
Gitlab/Github for repository
eclipse for java development
lwjgl

for sound:
audacity for audio file creation

for art:
inkscape so we can use vector graphics to scale the resolution of the game to match its window
